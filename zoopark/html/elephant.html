        <h2>Elephant</h2>

        <p>Elephant is the White Stripes' fourth full album and the second to be released by V2 Records. In this album, the White Stripes attempted to achieve the idea of "Back to Basics" as well as encouraging other rockers to try the same way.</p>
        <img src="../img/elephant2.jpg" alt="Elephant">
        <p>Including the song "I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself" (a Dusty Springfield/Burt Bacharach cover) in their repertoire was Meg's idea, and the band had begun to cover the song live. "You've Got Her in Your Pocket" was a song that had been written by Jack soon after the band's debut album was released in 1999. He had planned on eventually giving it to a local band to cover, but ultimately felt it was too personal to give away and decided to include it in the album. "Girl, You've Got No Faith in Medicine" was originally written for the band's previous album, White Blood Cells, but Meg had disliked the song and it was removed. After debating it, the song was rerecorded and included in Elephant, but only after a line from the song was removed after it was deemed too harsh.</p>

        <p>It was recorded over two weeks in April 2002 in London's Toe Rag Studios except for the songs "Well It's True That We Love One Another," which was recorded at Toe Rag in November 2001, and "I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself", which was recorded at the BBC's Maida Vale Studios. Jack White produced the album with antiquated equipment, including an eight-track tape machine and pre-1960s recording gear. As stated in the liner notes, White deliberately refrained from using computers during Elephant's writing, recording, or production. The White Stripes set their own rules while they were recording this album: ten days in a non modern studio. They chose to record in Liam Watson's modest Toe Rag studio in Hackney, London, England. The liner notes included the disclaimer, "No computers were used during the writing, recording, mixing, or mastering of this record," and none of the recording equipment was more recent than 1963.</p>

        <p>Elephant has been described musically as garage rock revival, blues rock, and punk blues. The album's lyrical themes revolve around the idea of the "death of the sweetheart" in American culture. In this album, the White Stripes expanded their style more than ever before, such as using a bass line - their rarity, piling with lead and rhythm guitar. Moreover, during the album Jack played guitar or keyboard to fill out the sound, but to the audience it still felt raw. Like other White Stripes records, the cover art and liner notes are exclusively in red, white, and black.</p>
